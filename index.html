								<h2> Incredible Energy</h2>
							</header>
							<p> Ecstatic Zouk Fusion parties are the ideal dance parties. Beautiful movements and structure from Zouk allow people
								to feel powerful in their bodies while freedom from Ecstatic and Fusion dance lets people express themselves. Ecstatic
								Zouk Fusion is the easiest and most fun dance style to learn. It can be done on any floor too, making it perfect
								for any venu, from dance halls to bars and yoga studios </p>
							<!-- old description -->
							<!-- Zouk Fusion helps us connect to ourselves, express our emotion, and grow our power. A hint of structure from traditional
								Zouk allows for greater focus than freeform ecstatic dance, while influences from Fusion dance allow the same degree
								of freedom. Zouk Fusion is a way to let loose while connecting with and feeling empowered in our bodies -->

								<h2> Awesome Connection</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Ecstatic Zouk Fusion makes connection effortless. Partner dancing raises the energy of the party further than many
								have ever seen at events where people primarily dance alone. The way Ecstatic Zouk Fusion is taught teaches people
								to feel the energy and trust themselves in a way that makes everyone feel very safe and very easily able to drop
								into themselves and the movement. The energy of the dance itself makes it perfect for events with or without alcohol
								and is sure to please all attendees. </p>

								<!-- The energy created between people when dancing together is intense and incredible. Dancing together can be both platonic
									and intimate, and when the vibration is there, dancing Zouk Fusion can be among the most energizing and healing experiences
									people have had. -->

				<h2>Meet Mason</h2>
				<img style="height: 600px " src="images/waterfall.JPG " alt=" " />

				<p style="text-transform:none !important">
					<br> Mason has been teaching and hosting dance events for the last 4 years and is also a yoga teacher, martial arts instructor,
					DJ, and musician. Mason created Ecstatic Zouk Fusion as a way to celebrate the beautiful body movements and masculine-feminine
					polar energy of Zouk while allowing for the freedom of expression of Ecstatic and Fusion dance.</p>
				<p style="text-transform:none !important">Mason's workshops start with a warmup lesson that teaches people how to dance this style while also getting them in the
					zone. The focus on energy, connection, and creativity allows people to find their own style and learn far faster than
					in a more traditional dance setting. This is followed by 2-3 hours of dancing and socializing which people remember
					for the rest of their lives.</p>
